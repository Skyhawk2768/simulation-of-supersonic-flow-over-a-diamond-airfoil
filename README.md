# Simulation Of Supersonic Flow Over A Diamond Airfoil

## Introduction

The project aims to determine the properties of a one-dimensional supersonic adiabatic
flow over a symmetrical diamond airfoil. One-dimensional adiabatic flow relations, such
as normal and oblique shock wave and expansion fan relations, and the upstream characteristics
of the flow are used to calculate flow properties on the upper and lower surfaces
and regions behind the airfoil’s trailing edge. The airfoil surface is divided into four
regions, and the region behind the airfoil’s trailing edge is divided into two. In all, the
region surrounding the airfoil is divided into seven.

+ Region 1 - Upstream of the airfoil
+ Region 2 - Leading side of the upper surface
+ Region 3 - Trailing side of the upper surface
+ Region 4 - Leading side of the lower surface
+ Region 5 - Trailing side of the lower surface
+ Region 6 - Behind the airfoil’s trailing edge and above the slip line 
+ Region 7 - Behind the airfoil’s trailing edge and below the slip line

The flow properties calculated for these regions are pressure, temperature, and Mach
number. The input parameters are the airfoil’s angle of attack, its half-wedge angle,
the ratio of specific heats of the gas, and the upstream values of the abovementioned
properties.
